### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* The `Token` class as well as all related elements
(`IResolvable`, etc...) were removed from this release. The feature may

with overlapping implementations in some consumers.

* add facility to validate construct ids

* Updated version number to 3.0.0

* PR feedback

* Removed Construct ID validator

* upgrading jsii runtime version in constructs requires
modules to update to the same jsii version to prevent version conflicts
in all non typescript/javascript language targets.

### Features

* remove Token/IResolvable API ([#34](https://github.com/aws/constructs/issues/34)) ([8f2b556](https://github.com/aws/constructs/commit/8f2b556db79f2823542afe210ee40bea57f29bea))
