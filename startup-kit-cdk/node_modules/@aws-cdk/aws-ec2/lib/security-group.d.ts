/**
 * Creates an Amazon EC2 security group within a VPC.

 * Security Groups act like a firewall with a set of rules, and are associated
 * with any AWS resource that has or creates Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs).
 * A typical example of a resource that has a security group is an Instance (or
 * Auto Scaling Group of instances)
 *
 * If you are defining new infrastructure in CDK, there is a good chance you
 * won't have to interact with this class at all. Like IAM Roles, Security
 * Groups need to exist to control access between AWS resources, but CDK will
 * automatically generate and populate them with least-privilege permissions
 * for you so you can concentrate on your business logic.
 *
 * All Constructs that require Security Groups will create one for you if you
 * don't specify one at construction. After construction, you can selectively
 * allow connections to and between constructs via--for example-- the `instance.connections`
 * object. Think of it as "allowing connections to your instance", rather than
 * "adding ingress rules a security group". See the [Allowing
 * Connections](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-ec2-readme.html#allowing-connections)
 * section in the library documentation for examples.
 *
 * Direct manipulation of the Security Group through `addIngressRule` and
 * `addEgressRule` is possible, but mutation through the `.connections` object
 * is recommended. If you peer two constructs with security groups this way,
 * appropriate rules will be created in both.
 *
 * If you have an existing security group you want to use in your CDK application,
 * you would import it like this:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const securityGroup = SecurityGroup.fromSecurityGroupId(this, 'SG', 'sg-12345', {
 *    mutable: false
 * });
