/**
 * Information on the Bootstrap stack of the environment we're deploying to.
 *
 * This class serves to:
 *
 * - Inspect the bootstrap stack, and return various properties of it for successful
 *   asset deployment (in case of legacy-synthesized stacks).
 * - Validate the version of the target environment, and nothing else (in case of
 *   default-synthesized stacks).
 *
 * An object of this type might represent a bootstrap stack that could not be found.
 * This is not an issue unless any members are used that require the bootstrap stack
 * to have been found, in which case an error is thrown (default-synthesized stacks
 * should never run into this as they don't need information from the bootstrap
 * stack, all information is already encoded into the Cloud Assembly Manifest).
 *
 * Nevertheless, an instance of this class exists to serve as a cache for SSM
 * parameter lookups (otherwise, the "bootstrap stack version" parameter would
 * need to be read repeatedly).
 *
 * Called "ToolkitInfo" for historical reasons.
